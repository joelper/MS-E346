# MS&E 346
This repository will consist of code, write-ups and formulas for assignments in MS&E346/CME241.
All text and code have been written by Joel Persson (joelpe@stanford.edu).

All code can be found in the Jupyter Notebooks named "Assignment XX". For simplicity, code that is reused has been written in PyCharm as well and stored in the modules folder. This simplifies reloading code written in earlier assignments.
